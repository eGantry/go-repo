Go game in Go Language

This started out as an innocent chat with ChatGPT about the origins of both the Go board game, and the Go programming language,
then it turned into a great excuse to gain a little knowledge about both, by merging them into one project.

Each working phase of the chat shows up here as a commit.  Unlike a lot of my chat-assisted Java projects, the code recommendations
from this chat worked without a lot of tweaking needed.

If you're following closely, you'll notice I bailed on the fancy text option, recommended in the chat, because wrestling with 
all the issues it created was distracting from the getting the main functionality working.

With the latest commit, I have a nice-looking, playable Go board for two players.
